## Description

If I'm going to be a software/web developer, I need to be able to showcase my skills to potential employers who are looking for developers with my skillset, so I've created a website to showcase my works, briefly describe myself, and provide contact information. It's important to be able to view this site on both desktop computers and mobile devices, so I set up a few media queries to account for many mobile devices.

## Installation
